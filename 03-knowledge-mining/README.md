# Lab 2 - Knowledge Mining with Azure Cognitive Search and Text Analytics

This lab covers Azure Cognitive Services, particularly [Azure Cognitive Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/) and the [Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/) service.

## Task 1 - Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data

Understanding the source datasets is very important in AI and ML. To help you expedite the process, we have created a Power BI dashboard you can use to explore them at the begining of each lab.

![Azure AI in a Day datasets](../media/data-overview-01-01.png)

To get more details about the source datasets, check out the [Data Overview](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/blob/main/data-overview.md) section.

To explore the dashboard of COVID-19 data, open the `Azure-AI-in-a-Day-Data-Overview` file located on the desktop (**C:\Users\public\desktop**) ðŸ’» of the virtual machine provided with your environment. If you see `Introducing the updated mobile layout` popup screen, then close it by click on `Got it`. Collapse the **Fields** and **Visualizations** tabs to see the clear report.

> **Note:** Please close and reopen the Power BI Desktop document if it throws an error in the first attempt.

## Task 2 - Explore lab scenario

Another critical problem to deal with when it comes to the volumes of research documents covering COVID-19 is the problem of advanced indexing and searching their content. The specific internal structure of research papers (including citations, contributors, and various entities like diagnosis, forms of examination, family relations, genes, medication, symptom or signs, and treatments) form a reach semantic graph that goes way beyond simple document categorization. An analyst would benefit significantly from exploring the corpus of documents in a way that takes all these complex relationships into account.

Using the Cognitive Search capabilities, we will create a complex index of documents that allows an analyst to perform an advanced search and explore the inter-document graph relationships.

The following diagram highlights the portion of the general architecture covered by this lab.

![Architecture for Lab 3](./../media/Architecture-3.png)

The high-level steps covered in the lab are:

- Explore dashboard of COVID-19 data
- Explore lab scenario
- Explore document search process
- Explore graph search process
- Add a set of new documents and trigger the index update process
- Explore the document and graph search and identify updated results

## Task 3 - Creating Azure Search Indexes

1. Navigate to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your credentials.  Then, select **Resource groups**.

    ![Open Azure resource group](media/azure-open-resource-groups.png)

2. Select the **AI-in-a-Day** resource group.

3. Select the Search service resource.

    ![The Search service is highlighted from the list of services in the AI-in-a-Day Resource Group](media/select-azure-search-service1.png)

4. Copy the search service URL and paste this into a text file.  Also make note of the service account name, which comes before `.search.windows.net`.

    ![The Search service's URL is copied to the clipboard.](media/copy-azure-search-url.png)

5. Navigate to the Keys setting and copy the Primary admin key. Paste this into a text file.

    ![The Search service's API key is copied to the clipboard.](media/copy-azure-search-api-key.png)

6. Download the `schemas.zip` from https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/ai-in-a-day/raw/main/03-knowledge-mining/schemas.zip. Unzip `schemas.zip`.  There are six files, three prefixed with `abstracts` and three with `covid19temp`.  Save these to a directory such as `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`.

7. Open the `abstracts_datasource.schema` file with a text editor and replace the segment starting `<< TODO:` with **<inject key="storageAccountConnectionString" enableCopy="true"/>** and then save the file.  Do the same for `covid19temp_datasource.schema`.

    ![The abstract data source is ready to be updated.](media/edit-abstracts-datasource.png)

8. Open a new PowerShell prompt.  Enter the following code, which will create an Azure Search data source, index, and indexer.

    ```powershell
    cd C:\Temp\AzureSearch\
    function Create-AzureSearchIndex {
        param
        (
            [string]$DataSourceFilePath,
            [string]$IndexFilePath,
            [string]$IndexerFilePath,
            [string]$AccountName,
            [string]$ApiKey
        )
        
        $Header = @{
            "api-key" = $ApiKey
        }
        $BaseUri = "https://" + $AccountName + ".search.windows.net"
        
        # Create Data Source
        $Uri = $BaseUri + "/datasources?api-version=2020-06-30"
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $Uri -Header $header -ContentType "application/json" -InFile $DataSourceFilePath
        
        # Create Index
        $Uri = $BaseUri + "/indexes?api-version=2020-06-30"
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $Uri -Header $header -ContentType "application/json" -InFile $IndexFilePath
        
        # Create Indexer
        $Uri = $BaseUri + "/indexers?api-version=2020-06-30"
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $Uri -Header $header -ContentType "application/json" -InFile $IndexerFilePath
    }
    ```

    ![The Create-AzureSearchIndex function has been created in PowerShell.](media/create-azuresearchindex.png)

9. In the same PowerShell prompt, call this function for the `abstracts` index and for the `covid19temp` index.  Then, fill in your Azure Search account name and Azure Search API key.
    - Azure Search Account Name: **aiinaday-cog-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - Azure Search API key: You saved Primary admin key in text editor in step 7, use that

    ```powershell
    Create-AzureSearchIndex "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts_datasource.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/abstracts_indexer.schema" "AZURE SEARCH ACCOUNT NAME" "API KEY"

    Create-AzureSearchIndex "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/covid19temp_datasource.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/covid19temp.schema" "C:/Temp/AzureSearch/covid19temp_indexer.schema" "AZURE SEARCH ACCOUNT NAME" "API KEY"
    ```

    ![The Create-AzureSearchIndex function has been run to create a new index.](media/create-azuresearchindex-use.png)

## Task 4 - Querying Azure Search Indexes

1. Navigate to [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your credentials.  Then, select **Resource groups**.

    ![Open Azure resource group](media/azure-open-resource-groups.png)

2. Select the **AI-in-a-Day** resource group.

3. Select the Search service.

    ![The Search service is highlighted from the list of services in the AI-in-a-Day Resource Group](media/select-azure-search-service1.png)

4. Select the **Indexes** tab and ensure that you have two indexes created.  If the Document Count is 0 for either, wait a couple of minutes and select **Refresh** until the document count appears.

    ![The list of Azure Search indexes.](media/search-service-indexes.png)

5. Once documents are available, select **Search Explorer** to open up the Search Explorer.

    ![The Search Explorer option is selected.](media/search-service-explorer.png)

6. Choose the **covid19temp** index and enter `RNA interference` into the Query string input box, and then select **Search**.  This will return the documents which include the phrase "RNA interference."

    ![Articles with the phrase RNA intereference.](media/search-explorer-rna-interference.png)

7. We can also see how many articles match a certain search string.  In the Query string input box, enter the phrase `Brazil&$count=true` and then select **Search**.  This will return 53 documents.

    ![53 articles reference Brazil.](media/search-explorer-brazil-1.png)

8. Each document returns a large number of fields, but we can specify the fields we would like to see.  In the Query string input box, enter the phrase `UNC Chapel Hill&$select=metadata/authors, metadata/title` and then select **Search**.  This will return the title as well as detailed information on each author.

    ![Paper titles and authors referencing UNC Chapel Hill.](media/search-explorer-unc.png)

9. The Azure Search service can also generate a demo application.  Return to the search service and select the **covid19temp** index.

    ![The covid19temp index is selected.](media/azure-search-indexes-covid19temp.png)

10. Select the **Create Demo App** option.

    ![The Create Demo App option is selected.](media/create-demo-app.png)

11. On the first tab select `metadata.title` for the Title and `abstract.text` for the Description.  Then select **Create Demo App**.  After the prompt, select **Download** to download an HTML file named `AzSearch.html`.

    ![Create a demo app.](media/create-demo-app-1.png)

12. Open the demo app HTML file.  In the search box, enter the phrase "RNA interference" and select the Search icon.  This will return 497 papers relating to RNA interference.

    ![Use the demo app.](media/search-demo-app.png)

10. Select the Search service.

    ![The Search service is highlighted from the list of services in the AI-in-a-Day Resource Group](media/select-azure-search-service1.png)

11. Navigate to the **Indexers** section and select the **covid19temp** indexer.

    ![The covid19temp indexer is selected.](media/azure-search-indexers.png)

12. Select the **Run** option to process the 100 documents.  Although we can configure an indexer to run periodically, this indexer will only run when manually engaged.  Select **Yes** to run the indexer.

    ![The covid19temp indexer is set to run.](media/azure-search-indexers-run.png)

13. The indexer will run.  It should complete within 15-30 seconds to process the 100 new documents.  You may need to select **Refresh** to see the indexer's progress.

    ![The covid19temp indexer has finished running.](media/azure-search-indexers-refresh.png)

14. Return to the **Indexes** tab for the Search service and ensure that the **covid19temp** index has 965 documents.  If it still reads 865, wait 30 seconds and select **Refresh** to check again.

    ![The covid19temp index has finished updating.](media/azure-search-indexes-update.png)

15. Select the **covid19temp** index to return to the Search explorer.  When we had 865 documents, 53 of them pertained to Brazil.  We can confirm that this update was successful by entering `Brazil&$count=true` and selecting **Search**.  This will now return 57 results instead of the prior 53.

    ![57 documents pertain to Brazil.](media/search-explorer-brazil-2.png)

## Task 6 - Using the Form Recognizer

    ![The covid19abstract project has been created](media/fott-new-project.png)

15. After creating a new project, you will be sent to the project for tagging.  In the **Tags** section, select **+** to create a new tag, which we will call `Abstract`.

    ![The Abstract tag has been created](media/fott-tags.png)

16. Wait for the layout to be run for the first document and locate the document's abstract.  Note that for some documents, the abstract is on the second page.  Then, move on to the next document.  We will tag each of the five papers, so navigate to each in turn, allowing the layout to be run.  In order for tagging to be successful, we must first run the layout of a document, navigate to another document, and return to this first document before we begin tagging.  Layout generation happens once per document, after which point we can return to it and tag our abstract.

    ![Running layout for a document](media/fott-running-layout.png)

17. Return to the second PDF and select each word in the **Abstract** section.  After highlighting this, select the **Abstract** tag to tag this section.  Note that you will need to select each word individually rather than selecting a box.  After selecting the **Abstract** tag, you should see a tag logo next to the PDF.  If you see the tag logo, this means that tagging was successful for this document.

    ![The first PDF has been viewed, and the second PDF has been tagged](media/fott-tagging-1.png)

18. Return to the first PDF and highlight the word **ABSTRACT** as well as the abstract.  If the abstract is lengthy, as in this example, it is okay to include just the first paragraph.  Then, select the **Abstract** tag to tag this document.  Ensure that the viewed icon (an eye) changes to a tag icon.  If it does not change to a tag but instead changes to a blank spot without any icons, tagging was unsuccessful.  In the event that tagging is unsuccessful, select another document, wait for it to have its layout run, and then return to the prior document and try tagging again.

    ![The first PDF has been tagged](media/fott-tagging-2.png)

19. Continue tagging until all five of the top papers are tagged.

    ![The first five PDFs have been tagged](media/fott-tagging-3.png)

20. Once we have tagged five documents, select the **Train** menu option, enter `Abstracts` as the model name, and select the **Train** option.

    ![The option to train a model has been selected](media/fott-train-model.png)

21. After the model has finished training, we will see results.  Although the estimated accuracy is not great, we will use this model.

    ![The Abstracts model has been trained](media/fott-train-model-results.png)

22. Return to the **Tags Editor** and select a new document, one you have not already tagged.  After the layout has been run, navigate to the **Actions** menu and select **Auto-label the current document**.

    ![Auto-label the current document](media/fott-auto-label.png)

23. We will see the results of auto-labeling and an estimated likelihood of success.  Furthermore, the document has an auto-labeled icon next to it.  If this is good enough, we can continue.

    ![The result of auto-labeling the current document](media/fott-auto-label-result.png)

24. In this case, auto-labeling was okay but missed a few words.  We can select all of the words in the abstract and then select the **Abstract** label.  This will show a new icon, representing an auto-labeled document with manual corrections.

    ![The result of correcting auto-labeling of a document](media/fott-auto-label-corrected.png)

25. We can update our model by returning to the **Train** page and re-training the `Abstracts` model.  The resulting estimated accuracy is slightly lower, but there is now another document available to improve model quality.  In this case, estimated accuracy is misleading.

    ![Retraining a model](media/fott-train-model-2.png)

26. After training the new model, select the **Analyze** menu option.  Select **Browse** and navigate to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` and select `2020.09.25.20201616v1.pdf`.  Select **Run Analysis** to see the results.  Note that the abstract is on page 2 of the PDF.

    ![An analyzed document](media/fott-run-analysis.png)

27. Select **Download** to download a Python script.  We will use this script in the next task.  Find the location where the script was downloaded and move it to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`.

    ![The option to download an analysis script is selected](media/fott-download.png)
    
> **Note! :** If you get a warning while downloading the Python file, select the ellipsis and select "Keep" to download the file. 

   ![Keep Python file](media/python-keep.png)

## Task 7 - Indexing a New Abstract

1. Open a command prompt (`cmd.exe`).  To do this, open the Windows menu, type in `cmd`, and select the **Command Prompt** application.

    ![The Command Prompt application is selected](media/open-cmd.png)

2. Run the command `pip install requests`.  To run this, you must have Python installed on the machine.  If `python.exe` is not accessible as part of the path--meaning you get an error when trying to run `pip`, navigate to where Python is installed.  The `pip.exe` program is inside the `\Scripts\` folder.

    ![Pip has installed the requests package for Python](media/pip-install-requests.png)

3. Navigate to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` in the command prompt by running `cd C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` and then run the analyzer script you downloaded at the end of Task 4.  The command to execute is `python analyze-843d.py 2020.09.25.20201616v1.pdf -o 2020.09.25.20201616v1.json`.  You will need to replace `analyze-843d` with the name of the script you downloaded.

    ![Analyze a PDF document](media/analyze-python.png)

4. Inside the `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` directory, there is a JSON file with the results of this analysis.  The file is fairly large and contains a detailed breakdown of the text analysis.  We will take the abstract text from this JSON file and write it to an Azure Search index.  To do this, open the Windows menu, type in **PowerShell** and select the PowerShell application.

    ![Open powershell](media/open-powershell.png)

5. Navigate to `C:\Temp\AzureSearch\` by running `cd C:\Temp\AzureSearch\`. Then, create the following function.

    ```powershell
    function Add-Abstract {
        param (
            [string]$AnalysisFile,
            [string]$AccountName,
            [string]$ApiKey
        )
        
        $paper_id = $AnalysisFile.Replace(".","_")
        $doc = Get-Content $AnalysisFile | ConvertFrom-Json
        $txt = $doc.analyzeResult.documentResults.fields.Abstract.valueString
        
        $jsonobj=@{
            value=@(
                @{
                    paper_id=$paper_id
                    abstract=@(@{
                        text=$txt
                        }
                    )
                }
            )
        }
        $json = $jsonobj | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
        $json | Out-File -FilePath WriteToIndex.json
        
        Write-Host $json
        
        $Header = @{

11. Note that the number of documents may not update to 866 immediately but given enough time, it will update to reflect the addition we made.

You may need to wait a minute or two before the numeric update occurs, but in the meantime the new document is searchable.
