# Setup the Lab 01 AI-in-a-Day Workspace

## Task 1 - Create resources

1. If it does not already exist, create a new resource group with the `AI-in-a-Day` prefix.
2. In the resource group, create a new [**Azure Machine Learning** service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/).
3. Once the new **Azure Machine Learning** service has been created, open it and click the **Launch studio** button to open the Azure Machine Learning studio. Alternatively, you can go directly to [ml.azure.com](https://ml.azure.com) and open your service from there.
4. In Azure Machine Learning studio, go to the **Compute** blade and create a new **Compute instance** which you will use to run the provided notebooks. Choose a `Standard_DS3_v2` CPU machine.
